,Spanish Language Specialist (Latin America) – AI Trainer,0,0,0,"Are you a Spanish (Latin America) language expert eager to shape the future of AI? Large‑scale language models are evolving from clever chatbots into powerful engines of linguistic discovery. With high‑quality training data, tomorrow's AI can democratize world‑class education, keep pace with cutting‑edge research, and streamline communication for Spanish speakers everywhere. That training data begins with you—we need your expertise to help power the next generation of AI.

We're looking for Spanish (Latin America) language specialists who live and breathe phonetics, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and sociolinguistics of the Spanish language. You'll challenge advanced language models on topics like verb conjugation, noun-adjective agreement, subjunctive usage, sentence structure, regional dialects, word order, idiomatic expressions, and cultural nuances—documenting every failure mode so we can harden model reasoning.

On a typical day, you will converse with the model on language scenarios, verify factual accuracy and logical soundness, capture reproducible error traces, and suggest improvements to our prompt engineering and evaluation metrics.

A master's or PhD in Spanish language, linguistics, or a closely related field is ideal; peer‑reviewed publications, teaching experience, or hands‑on linguistic analysis projects signal fit. Clear, metacognitive communication—""showing your work""—is essential.

Ready to turn your Spanish language expertise into the knowledge base for tomorrow's AI? Apply today and start teaching the model that will teach the world.

We offer a pay range of $8-to- $65 per hour, with the exact rate determined after evaluating your experience, expertise, and geographic location. Final offer amounts may vary from the pay range listed above. As a contractor you'll supply a secure computer and high‑speed internet; company‑sponsored benefits such as health insurance and PTO do not apply.
